# Instagram Clone: A Full-Stack React & Firebase Application
This project is a high-fidelity clone of the core features of the Instagram platform, built to demonstrate proficiency in modern full-stack development using the MERN-adjacent stack.

The primary focus of this application is to showcase experience with **React hooks, state management, and seamless integration with Google's Firebase backend services.**
<br/><br/>



## 🚀 Project Highlights & Demonstrated Skills
This application was built to showcase experience in the following areas:
- **Authentication Flow**: Complete user sign-up, sign-in, and sign-out functionality using Firebase Auth.
- **Real-time Database Interaction**: Utilizing Firestore to manage and display user data, posts, and profile information.
- **Component Architecture**: Creation of modular, reusable components using React props and hooks (useState).
- **Modern Styling**: Implementation of a consistent and responsive user interface using Chakra UI, ensuring a sleek, production-ready aesthetic.
